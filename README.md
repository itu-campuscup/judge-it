Welcome to **Judge IT**!
This project was created by the **CampusCup 2024-2025 board** for the 2025 CampusCup event at the IT University of Copenhagen.
The board will be responsible for the project, while the volunteers are welcome to contribute to the project.

## Why create Judge IT?

The judges had highlighted the issues of identifying the winners, when a race was very close.
Thus, the discussed the idea of creating a web application that would allow the judges to only focus on a single team at a time.

But while creating a whole new web application why not make the CampusCup event even more fun for the crowd?
The idea was to create a web app that could thus be used by the judges but also display fun statistics for the crowd to follow along with.

The idea is to include the following statistics:

- The best beer chug times
- The best spinning times
- The best sailing times
- The best overall times
- A players general stats ([Radar chart](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/RadarChart))

This is not a static list of statistics, but rather a list of ideas that the board has discussed.
The board is open to suggestions for other statistics that could be included in the web application.
