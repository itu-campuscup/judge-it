## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, we ask that you report vulnerabilities **privately via email** to the CampusCup board:

**[contact@campuscup.dk](mailto:contact@campuscup.dk)**

Please include the following details in your report:

*   **A clear description of the vulnerability.**
*   **Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.** This is crucial for us to verify and fix the issue. Please be as specific as possible.
*   **The potential impact of the vulnerability.**
*   **Any suggested mitigations or fixes (if you have them).**
*   **Your name or alias for acknowledgement (if desired).**

**What to Expect After Reporting:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **1 week** (but it may be longer as we are volunteers).
2.  **Initial Assessment:** Our team will investigate the reported vulnerability to confirm its validity and assess its potential impact. This process may take several weeks, depending on the complexity.
3.  **Communication:** We will keep you informed of our progress and may ask for additional information if needed.
4.  **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix. The timeline for a fix will depend on the severity and complexity of the issue.
5.  **Disclosure & Credit:** Once a fix is deployed, we may (with your permission) publicly acknowledge your contribution to improving the security of Judge IT, unless you prefer to remain anonymous. We will not issue CVEs for this project due to it being an internal tool.

**Scope:**

This security policy applies to the Judge IT application code and its direct dependencies. Issues related to the underlying Supabase platform should be reported directly to Supabase if they are platform-level vulnerabilities. However, if you find a vulnerability in how *we use* Supabase, please report it to us.

**Our Commitment:**

*   We will treat your report confidentially.
*   We will conduct a thorough investigation.
*   We will work to remediate confirmed vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
*   We will not take legal action against individuals who discover and report vulnerabilities in good faith and per accordance with this policy.

Thank you for helping keep Judge IT safe ðŸ’™
